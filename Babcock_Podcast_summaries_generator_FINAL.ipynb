        "<p> This notebook provides a comprehensive solution for an application that will provide users with a weekly a summary of each podcast episode that was released that week. This application will summarize each episode of the desired podcast, giving the user a personalized \"newsletter\" of helpful information when one is trying to identify if the episode is of interest or not. This will ultimately save the user time spent on scrolling through numerous pages of summaries provided by the podcast itself. Instead of wasting time clicking on each episode, the user can simply input the podcast they wish to explore to generate an on-command, personalized summary of numerous episodes that are available in the same place."

Last week we did one through five. The first segment today we'll do number six and seven. Then in the second segment number eight and nine. We'll close it with the tenth best prospect in the system as well as an honorable mention who's so close I almost had to put them head-in-head at ten and eleven.

I've been waiting a while to get the bottom half of this list out. I wanted to make sure that I didn't delay it for another full week. I really wanted to spend the time now to just get my full list out there because I spent a lot of time on it when I prepped that last show. There was a lot of debate in my head on where to go with those prospects. For those of you who didn't watch that show or listen to that show, my top five was Luis and Hello Cunha, Drew Gilbert, Jet Williams at number three, Ryan Clifford at number four, Ronnie Mauricio at number five. The first two prospects were the headliners in the Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander trades. Luis and Hello Cunha came over in a one for one with Max Scherzer or for Max Scherzer. Ronald Okunji, his little brother, guy who already has over 50 stolen bases this year and could make the big leagues next season as a really flashy, he could be a shortstop, but because of the Mets having the door, it could be a great defense of second baseman, probably be gold glove caliber over there and the guy that can get on base and steal a lot of them once he's there. Drew Gilbert, he's on a home run tear. He had another one tonight in Bigghamton. So he's really showing his stuff. He's been outstanding since coming over in that Justin Verlander trade. He's the number two prospect and the best outfield prospect in the Mets system. Number three is Jet Williams, who also homered tonight in Brooklyn. He's been unbelievable and high at 19 years old. So I felt he was deserving to be the number three prospects at the number four prospect. Ryan Clifford also came in the Justin Verlander trade. He homered tonight too. I feel like I just saw a bunch of tweets tonight about all of these guys hitting home runs. Clifford though, has 22 or 23 on the season in high A and he just turned 20 years old, not that long ago. A really, really talented prospect, but I think has the best raw power in this system. The number five is Ronnie Mauricio, who we've certainly spent enough time talking about over the last couple of weeks. So that's my top five. And the thing about it is three of those names were not in this organization a month ago. And that shows you how much deeper this farm system got, because as we start to filter through these names, you have to imagine all of them being bumped up three spots. So as we get to my number six prospect in the Mets system, which is Blade Tidwell, it's great to see him in that sixth spot for me. If he was your third best prospect, I feel a lot different about this system right now, because while Blade Tidwell is a very good pitching prospect. I feel a lot better with him being outside the top five than inside and even more so in the top three. I mean, this is a guy that still has a lot to prove, but he's had a very good first full season of professional baseball last year, drafted in the second round out of Tennessee. He turned 22 years old in June. He's six foot four, has a great fastball and everything is predicated off that. Also a good slider. He's been working with, I don't know if it's a different pitch, but I know he was talking about getting more sweep to his breaking stuff. Maybe it is more of a sweeper now. But I think the thing about Blade Tidwell is, is he going to be able to complement that fastball and look, coming into the baseball America had his fastball and his slider graded at a 60. So that's the 20 80 scale for prospects. It's hard to find 80 grade anything. That means that it's just like surefire can't miss 60 grade is really, really good. So baseball America coming into your head as a having a great fastball slider combo. Can you develop that third pitch so far this year to look at what he's done in high a made 17 starts pitched to a 309 era struck out 12.3 batters per nine. You know, and all together on the season, he's got 21 starts and 102 innings pitch with 132 strikeouts. Now that many innings pitched in his first professional season is a great sign when you're developing a starting pitcher. That's awesome. You know, let's say he finishes out this year healthy and gets that over 120 innings, maybe even pushing 125 130 all of a sudden next year can have that next bump up and you might get over 150. So that's a really big part about developing starting pitching. One of the reasons why I had him so high on this list. The other is just that his stuff I think is better than any other pitching prospect the Mets have in double like he struggled a little bit, but that's a big, big jump. Okay. And he's had a bad start. I can't remember how many runs to give. He had one really bad start. He's a four eight seven era and his last start this week, he went five scoreless. So you look at the overall numbers, they're all down. The strikeouts are down, but the walks are down too. So I think he's still competing and next year is going to be a year where he'll start in double A again and really try to make that rise up the system. Outside shot of a 2024 ETA, but more likely 2025. But the one prospect that you look at that you would hope has some frontline starter potential. More likely outcome is probably a three, but he's a guy that you can dream on a little bit. So because of that, and maybe sometimes I'm not the prospect analyst of prospect analysts that this is not, I cover the big league team and I, and I do this as well. But you know, when it comes to my grades, sometimes I have to be honest, the lack of system to me vaults a guy like Ted well up a little bit more. Maybe if you're a straight prospect analyst, you just have your own way that you evaluate these guys and you would stack up the value of a catching prospect like Kevin Perata and you know, a guy that would be a everyday position player who has a really good head tool and say that is more valuable than starting picture that I'm not positive is going to stay in a rotation because of course there is still some reliever risks with played Ted will, but I think if he did end up as a reliever, he'd be a very good high leverage one. The way he's pitched this year though, I'm getting more and more assuredness that he's going to stay as a starter to me. That's what made him number six. And then that obviously leads to my number seven prospect that I just alluded to there, which is Kevin Perata. I'm a little bit down on Kevin Perata. I've seen some people have products high as number three in their top 10. And going into the year, that was even where he started out from some. I mean, everyone was very high in Kevin Perata for good reason. He was a consensus top 100 prospect. He was the 11th overall pick in the draft last year. People were kind of surprised that he fell to 11. He hit 361 Georgia Tech, 453 on base, 709 slug. He had 26 home runs in 60 games, Georgia Tech. This year though, he's played pretty much exclusively in Brooklyn. He had a couple of games in St. Lucie on a rehab assignment. He's in 263, 344, 47, 788 OPS. His WRC plus is 114. WRC plus is way to runs creative plus measuring hitters based on a league average of a hundred. So he's only been 14% better than your league average hitter and he's only hit 11 home runs. He's got 20 doubles, four triples, 41 RBIs. The lack of home runs and the fact that he's not necessarily regarded as a great defensive catcher and look, I'd be lying if I told you I've been watching a ton of Brooklyn Cycling Games and watching how he's receiving back there. But you can read what's out there and there's no one that's raving about his defense. So he needs to sort of carry his profile with the bat and I would have expected him to put up better numbers in high A this year. That's a little bit concerning. So the fact that Blade Tidwell beat him to double A, that alone makes me want to put Tidwell above him. That's part of what went into the calculus there because I would have gone into the season betting on Perrata as the advanced bat hitting in high A to hit himself out of there quickly and move up to double A and it just hasn't happened. So we'll see. There's no reason to give up on Perrata. He's still relatively unprospectedly is 22 as well. So yeah, goes out next year and maybe starts the year in double A and you see how he handles that jump. We'll see. We'll see. He could come out and hit the ground runner next year and change the perception and vault right back up into the top five where he's supposed to belong. But that's how I looked at those two prospects. I think as we get to the rest of this top 10 list, it does fall off a little bit from there and I'll explain why as we get into number eight and nine in the next segment.

And I said the list falls off and that's not to knock these two guys that we're going to discuss here. It's more to illustrate that there is a lot less guarantees when we get to this part of the top 10. I think if you look at the top five prospects in the system, there's a combination of guys who you're pretty confident are going to be big leaguers with Acuna, with Gilbert, with Mauricio and guys with just immense upside who have already started to show it with Jet Williams and Ryan Clifford. Number six and seven, you have high draft picks out of colleges who are still high probability big leaguers. No matter what Kevin Perotta has done this year offensively, you would imagine that at some point based on the potential his bat has and the position he plays, Kevin Perotta can find himself up at the big league level with a shot to see what he can do. And Blade Ted Williams said the same thing about him joining a rotation some day. Now we get to 18 year olds and that's where it drops off because we don't know what these guys are going to become. But a lot of people really liked the Mets first round pick this year and that's why I have him slotted number eight. That's Colin Hauk. He was, you know, ended up drafted 32nd overall. He came out of high school. He was a two sport athlete. So he was a three star quarterback and he actually got some scholarship offers from power five schools. So he was a legit football prospect who did both. And he just recently at the end of his high school career switched and focused on baseball. Decided that was his path and he was great as a senior. OK, he hit 487, 589 on base, 857 slug, eight home runs, 16 steals. He won the Gatorade Player of the Year honors in the state of Georgia. When you look at the draft grades from MLB.com, they had him graded at 50 for fielding, 50 for running, 55 for power, 55 for hit, 60 grade arm and a 55 grade overall. That's a really solid foundation. OK, he's not bad at anything. Now he's 18. He's got to learn how to hit in professional baseball. He's got to learn how to be a professional. A lot has to still go right despite the upside and even the high floor based on everything we just discussed there. But he's a really good athlete who has a chance if he continues to develop as a hitter to be just an all around player. It's not completely dissimilar to the Jet Williams draft pick last year, and that one is working out extremely well. So we'll see how he performs, but he's barely even hit in the Complex League yet. So there's only so much that we can take from pre-draft grades. Still though, I think when you weigh out the upside compared to the other guys in this top 10, I had to put him at eight. Number nine is Marco Vargas. He came over in the David Robertson trade. He was the headliner with, I think I called him Robert Hernandez yesterday. It's Ronald Hernandez, the catching prospect who was ridiculously good in the Complex League with the Mets. Vargas, it was kind of the other way. He was great with the Marlins. He didn't really do all too well with the Mets, although he still had the good plate discipline drawing his walks, not striking out a bunch. In the Florida Complex League, which is obviously very young prospects, but he walked at a 21.9% clip. He only struck out at a 14.2% clip. And in 48 games, he had 270, 434 on base, 401 slug. They've now called both Vargas and Hernandez up as the Florida Complex League ended. They now are going to get a little bit of St. Lucie action. And then of course, next year, those guys will probably be the stars of the St. Lucie Mets along with HALC. And we'll see how they all end up developing. But a lot of people are high on Vargas. There's been more scouts professionally that have been able to see him on the backfields in spring training and then the Complex League and everything else. So there may be a little more information on him as a professional than HALC. But I think HALC's upside and just well around the game put him ahead of Vargas. But I really look at these guys as similar prospects where either one of them could be the one that next year tears up St. Lucie and is starring in Brooklyn by midseason. You're like, all right, that guy has vaulted himself into the top five. I think both of them have top five in the system upside and they both might reach it. So it's really exciting to kind of pair those guys together at this part of the top 10. And the big thing about him and again, why I said that it dropped off is just the unknown factor of 18 year olds. Right. When it comes to the final two prospects, we'll discuss today. They are not 18 year olds. Couple of pitchers who I think have a chance to contribute at the big league level next year and we'll discuss them in just a minute.

Part of the Locked On Podcast Network, your team every day. All right, so to close out our top 10, really top 11 prospects in the Mets farm system, got a couple of guys here. And the reason why I wanted to do 11 is because I don't think the gap is that great between these guys. I think if you get to the gap between 11 and 12 in this system, it's a lot wider. I think they're very, very close, these two pitchers. And honestly, if Ryan Mauricio had debuted earlier this season, they'd both be considered top 10 prospects in the system. And obviously Mauricio is going to continue to be a prospect going into next year, but at some point you think he's a big leaguer and it would slide these guys up. So if you're sort of framing your mindset towards 2024, who the top 10 prospects in the system will be, I do think they're both being included in that. And to choose between them is really hard because I'd almost call it even in some respects. But if you've been listening to the show over the last month here, as I focused more on prospects, you know the two names I'm talking about and you know who I like more. And that's Christian Scott and Mike Vassel. The guy having number 10 is Christian Scott. Now the reason I am viewing Scott ahead of Vassel is based on what we have seen this season. He dominated so far. Six starts in high A, he pitched to a 2,280 ERA. Ten starts in double A, 2.67 ERA. Here's the thing, he made that jump from high A to double A seamlessly and that is a tough, tough jump to make. But this guy did it with no problems. His whip, 0.80 high A, 0.84 double A. Pick up for 9, 10.27 high A, 10.83 in double A. Walk for 9, 1.52 in high A, 1.26 in double A. Over his last five starts, pitched to a 1.93 ERA, pitched at least six innings in three of those outings, went eight innings in one of them. He struck out 37 in 20 innings pitched during that five start span. He was a fifth round pick in 2021, he's 24 years old. He apparently is on the injured list right now. Very hard to know what it is in the minor leagues when a guy goes down. They pretty much keep all that stuff pretty tight lipped. It could be simple arm fatigue, it could just be, hey, innings limit. Last year you threw 58 and two thirds, this year he's at 83 innings. He's nearing a 30 inning jump already. Sometimes that's what they want to do, about a 30 inning jump. Maybe they're holding him out a little bit and then they're going to put him back in the rotation to make three starts at the end of the year, try to close it out strong and maybe get him over 100 innings. I could see that. Maybe the idea was to get him to 100 and he's at 83. So if they kept him in the rotation, he made five, six more starts, he would go over that. That could be it. But the reason why I have him over Mike Vassal is because I think there's a higher probability of him being better than a back end starter than Mike Vassal. And look, people say, oh, a guy, a prospect has a high probability of being a number five starter. And a lot of people look at that and they think, oh, then what value does he bring? You got to understand that saying he's better than what Tyler McGill has shown. Tyler McGill has not shown that he's a number five at the big league level. David Peterson has not shown that he's a number five at the big league level because they haven't been consistent. If you get a guy that's consistent at pitching to a low four ERA and isn't just constant train wreck, that's extremely valuable. And it's not to say that's what Vassal is going to be. But I think that you're getting closer and closer to a point where Vassal is going to make his debut. And what we've seen in Syracuse this year is a guy's pitching ERA over five. And earlier in double A, 10 starts, he did pitch to a 3-7-1 ERA. But Christian Scott, in 10 starts in double A, pitched to a 2-6-7 ERA. Now, it's different points in the season. But Vassal last year found his way up to high A. Scott had to start a level below this year. Vassal started in double A. Triple A was a big jump for him. He struggled a little bit. He has been better over his last three starts. He has a 1-8-3 year. I would love to see him in the big leagues this season. But when I project out the future, I just think the upside is a little bit more there with Scott. And I don't even know if the floors are that much different at this point. Because Christian Scott's ability to limit walks this year, attack in the zone and not get blown up and to really show great command of that fastball and a really nice slider. I think both of these guys are, can you really develop a great third pitch to pair off your top two and be able to face alignment three times in a row in the big leagues? That's tough to make it through that lineup a third time through. We'll see if either of them gets there. But of the two, I have a slight edge on Scott at this stage. Hey, Mike Vassal comes up, looks great this year. Who knows? Maybe as we get into our preseason top 10, maybe I'll change my mind on that. For now though, that is my top 10 list to reiterate. Number one, Luisa and Hella Cunha. Number two, Drew Gilbert. Number three, Jet Williams. Number four, Ryan Clifford. Number five, Ronnie Mauricio. Number six, Blade Tidwell. Number seven, Kevin Perata. Number eight, Colin Hauk. Number nine, Marco Vargas. Number 10, Christian Scott. And the honorable mention 11th is Mike Vassal.

Could he actually stick around beyond 2023? We'll discuss that on today's edition of Locked On Metz. You are Locked On Metz, your daily New York Metz podcast. Part of the Locked On Podcast Network. Your team every day. Hello to all you amazing Metz fans who are listening to Locked On Metz. Part of the Locked On Podcast Network. Your team every day. Thank you for making Locked On Metz your first listen every day. Locked On Metz is free and available on all platforms including YouTube. The Metz won a series on Wednesday in the first segment today. I will discuss a nice win and really DJ Stewart's role in it. He had a breakout game where he put his name on the map. So I want to talk about that. Then in the second segment, go a little bit more into his background if you're not aware where Stewart came from. And if there's a chance he can stick with the Metz beyond 2023. Then final segment, talk about the Metz versus the Cardinals and potentially more likely the last time the Metz ever had to face Adam Wainwright. What that could look like and then we'll take a little trip around the minor league affiliates. Before we get to any of it though, I'm HerosRyan Ficklestein. If you want to find any of my work, follow me on Twitter at FicklesteinRyan. You can also find some of my writing at JustBaseball.com where I work as the managing editor. Today we're going to lead off with a game recap because guess what? The Metz won a series. But really there's a story that came out of this game that's actually a feel-good one that maybe means something to this franchise moving forward. And that is the breakout of DJ Stewart. Now this does not mean that because of one two home run game, suddenly DJ Stewart is the starting right fielder for the New York Mets moving forward. But when you look at a team with the Rafael Ortega's of the world, Danny Mendick, Jonathan Aruz, there's a lot of guys that are playing baseball right now that you don't expect to be long term fixtures with the Mets or even guys that wear a Mets uniform beyond this season. Guys that are just eating innings for the Mets in a lost year. DJ Stewart is a tier above all those guys. Whether he's going to be a part of the 2024 Mets or not, which we will discuss in the next segment, he certainly looks like a big leaguer. He looks like a guy that could have a couple more years of big league service time ahead of him where he can go out and get some major league checks. And as he talked about the game, buy a lot of diapers for his daughter. As he said, diapers are expensive. That's what keeps him going. He's had a rough time over the last couple of years dealing with injuries and he's really having a nice year overall at the Mets. He was good in Syracuse and now he's putting up some good at bats with the big league club. But really, he was the reason they won this game and this series. He was great. And it was just a nice day Mets baseball game. For what should I go? It's a good watch. You can see your team go out and win. And I know there's starting to be contingent of Mets fans that are rooting for losses that are looking at the lottery and the Pirates are a team that now is ahead of them in the lottery. But for me, I feel like that stuff's going to handle itself. I just like watching the Mets win baseball games and I like watching a starting pitcher not be completely awful. And while I don't believe that Tyler McGill has suddenly turned a corner instead, I think he was just playing a bad team. But hey, he got through five innings and for that you deserve a steak dinner at this point. He gave up two runs, was a two run homer, five hits allowed, walked four so it wasn't pretty. But he got through it and thank you to the Pirates for allowing him to do that. DJ Stewart hit his first home run to get the Mets on the board in the second inning, a solo shot. The Mets actually scored a couple more runs that inning as Omar Nerviah is doubled. Rafael Ortega and Brandon Nemo each drew walks and then Francisco Lindor drove in a pair with a bases loaded RBI single. The three nothing Mets lead would hold for a very short time. I mean, the lead held, but that wide lead was short and quickly as Tyler McGill gave up that two run homer in the following inning. But the Mets got a run back on a Brandon Nemo single. They were up four to two and then DJ Stewart did something on the defensive side for the Mets. The Pirates had a man on first. It was Andrew McCutcheon, Jack Sawinski hit a double into the corner and DJ Stewart executed a perfect relay throw to Jeff McNeil, who made it even better throw home to gun down McCutcheon at the plate and get McGill out of that inning and out of the game. And then bottom half of the fifth, Stewart comes up, hits another home run. And the thing about these home runs from DJ Stewart, they aren't just the wall scrapers. He's hitting bombs. He's hitting the ball with authority. And it really makes you wonder if there's some staying power here. Now look at the rest of the game. Not that it matters too much. Phil Bickford gave up a run in the sixth. The Mets end up getting a couple back in the seventh. Pino Lanzo hits his thirty sixth home run of the season. And then Rafael Ortega has an RBI single. The Mets end up winning the game eight to three. But again, the big story of the day is Stewart, a guy that obviously had a great game. And when you have one great game, you've only played twenty five games in the season. Your numbers are going to shoot through the roof. But still, this is a man that hit sixteen home runs and fifty one games since Syracuse and now has four in the big leagues. And he looks the part. He looks athletic enough. He can play a corner spot in the outfield. And I think when you just try to zoom out a bit and think about the Mets next year and guys that you want to keep around and you're watching this team play right now, it really comes down to this for me. If you could tender a contract to one of these two guys, who are you picking? Going into next year, would you rather see DJ Stewart back or Daniel Vogel back back? Because Vogel back, you could keep them. You could tender them a contract, bring them on back down. And go through another year where he clogs up your spot and he's a great guy in the clubhouse. But the guy doesn't play a position that can't hit left handed pitching. DJ Stewart at least can play a spot in the outfield. He is certainly more athletic and the power to me looks better than that of Vogel back. And guess what? Stewart walks a lot, too. So when I look at the 2024 Mets, I'm starting to see a future where DJ Stewart could be a fourth outfielder for this team. And while it's not the biggest thing to find in the world in these final six, seven weeks of baseball, it's not nothing. And I want to talk about where Stewart came from a little bit more, get you some more details on his background if you're not aware of how he got to the Mets and what he did prior.

Catch every pitch in the Mets hometown broadcast with Sirius XM on the SXM app. Just search Mets. I want to give you a little more background on DJ Stewart. For those of you who aren't aware about where he was drafted or his playing career up to the point where now he is with the New York Mets. He was a first round pick back in 2015 by the Baltimore Orioles. There is a connection there with Buck Show Walter in his last season at Florida State before getting drafted. DJ Stewart hit three eighteen. He got on base at a five hundred clip and he slugged at a five ninety four clip with fifteen home runs, twelve stolen bases and fifty nine RBI and sixty four games. He ended up making his MLB debut in twenty eighteen playing seventeen games down the stretch for Buck Show Walter before he was let go by the Orioles. He posted an eight ninety OPS in those first forty seven plate appearances. Now twenty nineteen he was up and down forty four games in the big leagues. He only had a six ninety eight OPS but in sixty three games in triple A. Fared much better at two ninety one three ninety six on base five forty eight slug twelve home runs. Nineteen doubles. Twenty twenty he played about half of the sixty game season for the Orioles played in thirty one games had an eight oh nine OPS. So he was pretty solid. Twenty twenty one was his one real full year in the big leagues. Hundred games played hit two oh four had a three twenty four on base three seventy four slug six ninety eight OPS twelve home runs ten doubles thirty three RBI and three hundred eighteen plate appearances. Now last year he was hurt. He only played three games with the Orioles five games rehabbing in the Florida Complex League and then twenty nine games in triple A where he did have an eight seventy OPS this year. There's been some injuries too. He spoke about those a bit after the game today but in fifty one games in Syracuse as I already mentioned he had sixteen home runs. He had two twenty nine three sixty two on base five sixteen slug and the big thing for me is the plate discipline. He walked fifteen point three percent of the time struck out twenty point one percent of time with the Mets this year. He's walked twelve point three percent of time struck out twenty four point six percent of the time. Small sample size is twenty five games played but the numbers are solid right now. He's hitting two thirty four three thirty nine on base five thirty two slug got the OPS in the high eight hundreds. That's really good. And his WRC plus is one thirty seven. Now that again matters hitters based on a league average of one hundred. So he's thirty seven percent better than your league average hitter. That's an amazing number and it is largely ballooned by a two home run game because he went into the day with a one oh four WRC plus. But you hit two home runs and you're just barely over 50 played appearances on the season. He's at was it fifty seven right now. Yeah that's going to really really juice the stats. But you look at his career in the big leagues he's now played two hundred nineteen big league games six hundred and seventy nine or I guess two hundred and twenty. You add in today so you add in today changes numbers is before today if you look at fan graphs to comprise his whole big league career. It was two hundred nineteen games played six hundred and seventy five played appearances. He said two twelve three twenty seven on base four hundred slug. So that's a seven twenty seven OPS. That's not bad. His WRC plus at ninety nine about a league average hitter. He's walked in thirteen point two percent of his big league played appearances struck out twenty six point eight percent of the time. So that's his whole big league career. That is the full season in twenty twenty one. That's parts of twenty eighteen twenty nineteen twenty twenty and then what he's done in the small sample size this year. This is a guy that still hasn't really gotten his feet wet and really established himself as a big leader. But he is a former first round pick who clearly has town. I mean you watch him play you think all right there is something here. He also tore the cover off the ball in spring training too I might add. I think the Mets might have something here in D.J. Stewart is not to say OK I'm swayed by a single game but I do think if he can stay healthy down the stretch I want him in a lineup every single day over Rafael Ortega over Danny Mendick. I know they don't all play the same positions but my larger point is get D.J. Stewart in there let him face lefties. Let's just see because if you look at the Mets 40 man roster heading into next year I could see him on it. I really could and I mentioned the Daniel Vogelbach not comparison but just the thought exercise. If you go into next season you have to tender one of them a contract. Who do you tender a D.J. Stewart to me seems like a much more valuable player to a roster off the bench. I would hope that neither of those guys is penciled into a starting lineup on opening day and if they are the Mets got some issues. But you go into next season you think about the outfielders come opening day. Stale Marte so many he gets healthy and you hope he's more like the 2022 version himself. He's going to be the starting right fielder. Brandon was going to be the starting center fielder left fielders now gaping hole. Mark Hanna if he had stuck around they didn't trade him. Maybe the Mets would have picked up his club option. He's gone. We'll see maybe the Brewers don't and you can reunite with can unfree agency. Even then I don't know if fans would be necessarily happy with Mark Hanna being the opening day left fielder. Now question would be how do the young players factor in at this point unless something changes drastically over the next six and a half weeks. Whatever it is in the season. I don't think it's prep baby or Ronnie Mauricio. That's pencil into that spot. Can those guys win jobs and win playing time in spring training? Yes and are the Mets at the team that would leave that door open for one of those guys to grab some spots in spring training to grab some at bats. I think there's a chance that they are that team that's maybe not as all in and free agency as they've been in years past. But I still think they're going to add a pretty significant outfielder to start next year in free agency. I imagine someone's going to get added but are they going to add two guys? Maybe I don't know. I could see them going into next season with DJ Stewart as the fourth outfielder and you know you basically just see exactly how the season plays out. Stewart could be with him the whole year or he could start on the opening day roster and you know who knows maybe Drew Gilbert finds his way up to the big leagues at some point next season. Maybe Luis and Hala Cunha finds his way up and he's playing some outfield. We have no idea what the 2020 formats are going to look like. It is way too early to be really thinking about the opening day roster next year. But from what I've seen in the short sample size of all the guys you're going to watch play baseball down the stretch here, DJ Stewart is one to have your eye trained to a little bit more because there is a chance here that the Mets have found a guy that can be in their outfield rotation for the next couple of seasons. You have control of him if you want it up until 2027. You have three arbitration years if you want them. One attendor in the contract that is on the table for the Mets. And again based on the fact that he's a former first round pick who's put up pretty good numbers throughout his minor league career who has been about a league average hitter when he's been at the big league level. I think the Mets could probably do a lot worse than DJ Stewart moving forward. So I'm looking forward to seeing if he can keep this up and have a nice little finish to the season for the Mets and maybe earn himself a job next year. So we'll see what it looks like. But he's definitely the story of the day and it finally gave us something positive to talk about on the big league diamond which we just haven't had in a long time. Now the question is can the New York Mets leave a great final impression on Adam Wainwright because this will likely be the last time you ever have to watch Adam Wainwright pitch against the New York Mets in their series against the Cardinals this weekend. Well really this game will be on Thursday and I want to preview that match up a little bit and also take a trip around the minor league affiliate.

The New York Mets play the St. Louis Cardinals 715 Eastern time tonight catch every pitch in the Mets hometown broadcast with Sirius XM on the SXM app just search Mets. Now if you're going to watch one game in this series against the Cardinals it's tonight's matchup it's Jose Kitana pitching against the team that he finished last year with first Adam Wainwright and this year Adam Wainwright has been an absolute disaster probably should not have come back for his age 41 season the velocity has been down and he has just looked awful last year he was great pitchers and he was a great player and he was a great player. He's been a great pitcher with three seven one ERA across 32 starts racked up a hundred and ninety one and two third innings pitched this year in 15 starts he's gotten eight seven eight ERA in 66 and two third innings he is three and seven he's one of the reasons why the Cardinals have been so bad this year and you look at his last three starts. He gets the Cubs on July 29th got through six innings gave up for earned August 4th against the Rockies gave up seven earned on nine hits pitch only three innings last start out against the Kansas City Royals Adam Wainwright in one inning gave up nine hits. And eight earned runs no walks no strikeouts woof we all know Adam Wainwright's history with the Mets I don't need to get into it but 20 20 geez 2006 and LCS a young Wainwright did something that we all like to forget now here we are how many years later is that cheese 2006 is it? 17 years later and he's clearly on his last legs finishing off what has been a great big league career and now he gets the pitch against this Mets team the Royals can knock him up for eight earned you'd hope the Mets could beat up Adam Wainwright and honestly I just don't know it's actually the Fox game why are the Mets playing so well? I guess you went into the season thinking oh middle of August Mets Cardinals that'll be a great matchup but man I don't know it's gonna be interesting to say the least you would think the Mets should win that game but I am just fascinated to enjoy it either way to either enjoy the Mets beating up Adam Wainwright on his way out or for Adam Wainwright to embarrass the Mets and I just get to laugh because it's better to laugh than cry. So we'll see how that one shakes out the rest of the series we don't know who's gonna pitch on Friday against Zach Thompson for the Cardinals left-handed pitcher with the 396 ERA this year the Mets are giving Kodai Senga an extra day rest and I imagine they do that throughout the rest of the season no reason to push Senga you know let him finish the year strong and always pitch with that extra day rest. Next year you can go back to trying to get him to pitch on regular rest but for now it makes sense and particularly because I guarantee you they're lining him up for Ghost Fork glow in the dark ball night which is not this Friday obviously but next Friday we'll talk about that promotion at more length later because it's against the Angels and Shohei Atani which I do not think is a coincidence but if they give him an extra day here like they did and they do that again Senga will start that Friday night blackout night city field you hope to get a big crowd I'm sure they do that so you'll see him pitch on Saturday it's Miles Michaelis who has a 427 ERA this year and then Carlos Carrasco will go back out there again to close out the series on Sunday against Dakota Hudson so that's what we got ahead Mets versus Cardinals four games set against two teams that are nowhere close to playoffs biggest disappointments in the National League who are playing more for the lottery balls. Then you know trying to put W's in the win column and no really directly competing in that regard so guess it's a win win series either you win the series or you win the lottery stuff let's take a quick trip around the affiliates always got to grab the big M to the rumble ponies hat before we do this one and you know let's start there because that's actually the one positive note I think of all the games that's true Gilbert drew Gilbert had a big big day to. Day to day to night geez I don't even know that enough they played a day game or night game I just looked at the box score I'm going to be completely honest so it's what I just say to tonight. Tonight drew Gilbert went through for five that with a double and two runs scored he has been awesome coming over to the rumble ponies we said hella Cunha has not been over for the walk and run scored believe you sitting below them and does the line a buck 40 and change that exactly what you like to see I think that's what we carried away about that one big M to the loss 10 to 7 Tyler Stewart had his second rough start in a row here if you remember when I was breaking down all the great pitching the Metro supposed to have in double a Stewart was one of these guys that had an unbelievable season. Up till about a week ago today where he was leading the minorities in the array is a huge guy six foot nine and just been having a lot of success and then gets knocked around his last time out and this time only pitches three innings gives up three earned on three hits and three walks did strike out six though of the nine outs that he recorded. Let's move down to Brooklyn looking at what the cyclones did today they lost seven to one Alex Ramirez and Ryan Clifford the two prospects really paying attention to on Brooklyn right now both went over for with two strikeouts a piece not a good day there. Finally Syracuse one seven to three quiet day for Brett Beatty and Ronnie Mauricio Ronnie was over for with a walk and two strikeouts Beatty one for four with a strikeout but hey the team won at least well for all you every dayers on tomorrow's show we're going to recap whatever happened against Adam Wainwright and you'll have a lot more farm report action we'll do our Friday farm report looking at the Mets minor leagues.

              "\"In this episode of the Locked On Mets podcast, host Ryan Finklestein discusses the New York Mets' recent win against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He highlights outfielder DJ Stewart's breakout performance in the game, in which he hit two home runs and made a crucial defensive play. Finklestein notes that while Stewart's performance does not guarantee him a spot as a long-term fixture on the team, he looks like a solid player who could have a future in the major leagues. He compares Stewart to other players on the team who are only filling in for the season and suggests that Stewart has more potential and value. Finklestein also provides stats and background information on Stewart's career, highlighting his power and plate discipline. He suggests that Stewart could potentially be the fourth outfielder for the Mets in the 2024 season. Finklestein then previews the Mets' upcoming series against the St. Louis Cardinals, focusing on the matchup between Mets pitcher Jose Quijada and Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright. He discusses Wainwright's decline in performance this season and speculates on how the Mets will fare against him. Finklestein concludes the episode with a brief recap of the Mets' minor league affiliates' recent games.\""
